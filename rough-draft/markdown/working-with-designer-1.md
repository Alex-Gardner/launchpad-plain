A [design brief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_brief) is a document meant to clarify the scope of a design proposal. The presence or absence of a brief may be the difference between a successful, streamlined, creative project and one beset with confusion, befuddlement, and overruns. Since a brief is a collaborative document, expect some evolution as each stakeholder provides their input. This post is designed to prompt the development of an initial design brief - creating a strong bedrock for a fruitful design collaboration. 


Answering the prominent questions thoroughly - and honestly - will provide an exceptional starting point for any designer to create apt compositions without the need for extensive revisions or overhauls. Primary focus is divided into three categories:  the business, the audience, and the experience.

## The Business

<div class="call-response" markdown="1">

### What kind of business are you?

The word “business” here is interchangeable for a more fitting concept. If you are part of a group not involved directly in commerce, “organization” might be a better fit. For an individual or a more informal gathering, choose a convenient term.

##### Closing Thoughts

At this point, after answering all the questions above, we have started to create a number of advantageous tools to assist in any design work. As a result, we have assembled:  

* A mood board to convey the tone and character of our project.
* A clear account of products, services, users and goals. 

 
From this, we can much more easily create marketing copy which best matches the goals, mood, and expectations of the end users. It is thus considerably easier to create and arrange design assets that are purpose aligned and fit the business vision effortlessly.
